Final Project Parameters
	
- Your final project will be a stand-alone interactive narrative game with the following parameters:
- Created using Twine 2
- At least 7,500 words long
- At least three (3) characters in the story
- At least 15 player choices in the story, with three different choice options per choice
- At least four (4) locations in the story
- No line of dialogue or narration may be longer than 200 characters
- At least six separate and different endings to the story
- It must be checked for spelling and grammar
- It IS permitted to use “Click to Continue” between screens for this project. Usually in professional projects this is frowned upon, but this is a class, and we are simulating how a lot of mobile games operate with narrative (where you are required to tap to continue).
- There are no requirements to add special colors, formatting, visual effects, graphics, audio and formatting, but Twine 2 does support this, and extra credit will be granted for successful use of these extras.
